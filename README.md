# Analyze-Movie-Reviews-with-TensorFlow
In this session, we will demonstrate natural language processing using deep learning with the open-source TensorFlow library. We’ll build a machine learning model trained on a vast movie review dataset taken from IMDB - preparing the data using various techniques and incorporating multiple Keras layers for best results (rather than just a single dense layer) - before providing our system with custom reviews of our own and asking it to predict tone and favourability.  Prerequisites: —Basic knowledge of Python —Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts —A Python IDE, like Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)  -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Social media: —Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings —Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings —Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #TensorFlow #MachineLearning #DeepLearning
